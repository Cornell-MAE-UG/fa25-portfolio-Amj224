## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, I am a current senior attending Cornell University Studying Mechanical Engineering. Who loves experimenting with how different systems interplay with each other as well as pursuing aerospace, robotics, automobiles. I was the co-lead of the Sportsman subteam at Combat Robotics @ Cornell and now the new member training lead. I love the competition aspect of the team as well as the community and teamwork that is implemented in build sessions.

Some non technical things about me are that I love to read, I'm an F1 fan, and I have been a sailing instructor at Cornell University since my freshmen spring (2023): I love to be outdoors and on the water as well as meet new people and share my love of sailing with them.
